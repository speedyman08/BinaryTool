# BinaryTool
A WIP tool that is able to convert binary to ascii text and back

- I'm using this project to learn Kotlin, so expect bad or unreadable code
- Basically everything in this project is implemented by me (the CLI parser, binary converter, etc.)
- If you have any suggestions that can improve the code, please open an issue as that would really help me become a better <br> programmer

I'll look into making this a native application since Kotlin supports LLVM
